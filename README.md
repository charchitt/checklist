# checklist

while exploiting a machine from either vulnhub or hack the box, i refer to this file a refernce, or a checklist. This includes the files you should use for fuzzing or the way you should be enumerating a port or service. 
There is a lot of amendments to be made in this. 
will keep updating this.

hope this helps you in ssome way
